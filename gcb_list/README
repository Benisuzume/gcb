gcb_list generates a list of rooms based on roomen.sqlite.

If you have a newer version of Garena, copy roomen.dat from your Garena installation to gcb_list/bin/roomen.sqlite.
Then, run gcb_list.jar. A rooms.txt text file will be outputted with a list of rooms.

Note that roomen.sqlite must be in the directory from which you run gcb_list.jar.
