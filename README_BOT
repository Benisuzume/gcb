gcb_bot 0d
----------

gcb bot is a Garena chat bot.
The current version has been significantly extended by XIII.Dragon and can be used with a GHost database.

Installation
------------

In addition to gcb installation, you also have to create a MySQL database using install.sql.
Then, add a user to the database, and specify login information in SQLThread.java.

Alternatively, you can specify a GHost database.

To enable gcb_bot, set "gcb_bot" to true in the configuration file.
gcb will also run unless gcb_bot_disable is true.

Compilation
-----------

When compiling, you can set the main class as GChatBot.java.
Then, "gcb_bot" does not have to be set in the configuration file.

    !say <message>: say <message>
