gcb_bot 0c
----------

gcb bot is a very simple Garena chat bot.
The current version is meant to only provide basic functionality so that others can see how it may be extended for specific purposes.

Installation
------------

In addition to gcb installation, you also have to create a MySQL database using install.sql.
Then, add a user to the database, and specify login information in SQLThread.java.

You probably want to manually add an admin to the database, or nothing will work:
    INSERT INTO gcb.admins (username) VALUE ('garenauser');

To enable gcb_bot, set "gcb_bot" to true in the configuration file.

Compilation
-----------

When compiling, you can set the main class as GChatBot.java.
Then, "gcb_bot" does not have to be set in the configuration file.

Commands
--------

Admin commands:
    !addadmin <username>: adds an admin
    !deladmin <username>: deletes an admin
    !say <message>: say <message>
    !w <username> <message>: whisper <message> to <username>
    !exit: exit

Public commands:
    !myip: get user's external IP address
