gcb rcon is a feature of gcb that allows you to send commands through sockets.
This file basically tells you how to set it up and how to send a command.

== Configuration ==

Set gcb_rcon = true in gcb.cfg to enable gcb rcon.

Then, you may wish to set additional options:
	rcon_bind:
		the default, 0.0.0.0, means the rcon server will bind to all addresses.
		if you only want to bind to one address, you should set this, otherwise leave as default
	rcon_port: this is the port gcb rcon will use, default is 7464
	rcon_localonly: if this is true (default), then gcb rcon will only accept local connections
	rcon_password: the password needed to authenticate into gcb rcon

== Protocol ==

The protocol is simple. Each command is simply text, and commands are separated by newline characters.

The password must be the first "command" received by gcb rcon. If the password is incorrect, you will be disconnected.
Note that if rcon_password is blank, it will be impossible to connect because blank lines are ignored...

== Send a command ==

Here, we will use telnet.
This assumes gcb_rcon is running locally on port 7464, and the password is "password":
	telnet localhost 7464
	> password
	> exit nicely

Then gcb will exit nicely. To disconnect:
	Ctrl+]
	> quit
